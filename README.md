# Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained ECG and CMR Encoders with a Modular Pipeline and Comprehensive Evaluation for Cardiovascular Diagnostics
> Authors: Dominik Filliger & Noah Leuenberger (2025)

This repository provides a modular deep-learning pipeline for ECG and CMR representation learning, building on the work of Turgut et al. (2025) and extending the MMCL-ECG-CMR approach. Designed with reproducibility, extensibility, and adaptability in mind, the pipeline enables systematic experimental configurations while integrating preprocessing, training, and postprocessing workflows. Its modular architecture supports easy customization, allowing seamless integration of new components without disrupting the core framework. Accompanied by comprehensive technical documentation, the pipeline facilitates efficient adoption and future extensions for diverse research applications in the field of cardiovascular diagnostics. In the creation of this framework and all related code of this repository, AI coding assistants were used.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install Rye**
   To install Rye, visit the [official website](https://rye.astral.sh/guide/installation/) and follow the instructions. For Unix-based systems, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -sSf https://rye.astral.sh/get | bash
   ```

2. **Setup Project**
   ```bash
   # Clone repository
   git clone https://github.com/IPOLE-BAT-CMR-ECG/dl-framework.git
   cd dl-framework

   # Install dependencies
   rye sync --no-lock

   # Pull project data (requires access request from team)
   dvc pull  # This will set up the exact data configuration used in our work
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp sample.env .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys for Weights & Biases / Neptune
   ```
