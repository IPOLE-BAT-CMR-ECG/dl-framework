# Aether: Deep Learning Pipeline for ECG and CMR Data

Welcome to Aether, a comprehensive framework for deep learning on Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging data. This pipeline streamlines the process of developing, training, and analyzing deep learning models for cardiac data analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- **Modular Pipeline Architecture**
    - End-to-end workflow from preprocessing to evaluation
    - Advanced artifact generation for model interpretation
    - Comprehensive metrics and analysis tools

- **Dataset Integration & Processing**
    - Standardized interface for ECG and CMR datasets
    - Automated validation and preprocessing pipeline
    - Multi-format data support with efficient loading

- **Model Development**
    - Flexible training configurations with distributed capabilities
    - Support for various deep learning architectures
    - Built-in visualization and interpretability tools

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To begin working with Aether:

1. Follow our [Installation Guide](getting-started/installation.md) to set up your environment
2. Configure your pipeline using the [Configuration System](getting-started/configuration.md)
3. Learn about [Dataset Integration](data/datasets.md) to prepare your data
4. Explore [Model Training](models/training.md) to start training your models

## ðŸ”¬ Research Foundation

This project builds upon state-of-the-art research in cardiac deep learning, particularly the work by Turgut et al. Their paper on information transfer between ECG and CMR data has provided valuable insights for this implementation:
