  # From Turgut et. al (2025):
  #   "We augment the 12-lead ECG data using
  #   random cropping (scale=0.5 only during pre-training),
  #   Gaussian noise (sigma=0.25 during pre-training, 0.2 during finetuning),
  #   amplitude rescaling (sigma=0.5 during pretraining and fine-tuning),
  #   and Fourier transform surrogates (phase noise magnitude=0.1 during pre-training, 0.075 during fine-tuning)."
